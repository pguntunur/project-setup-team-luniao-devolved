## Project description
Everyone knows that planning a trip involves lots of details and moving parts. Travel Wise is a web application that makes it easy for individuals and groups to make and keep track of their travel plans. Users can create polls or checklists and receive recommendations for activities, hotels, flights, and much more based on budget, trip purpose, and interests. Users can access our app through a guest account that will allow them to create a personalized itinerary. This itinerary can also ultimately be logged when a user creates an account, giving them the ability to add other users and form group trips to keep track of previous trip history.

### Project Vision Statement
Our Minimum Viable Product should have:
* User register and login functionality, guest users will have limited access
* User-specific dashboard which will display links to all features of the app 
* Guest dashboard which will display links to create a sample itinerary 
* User profile, with a profile picture which users can upload
* Basic group trip creation with user hierarchy (admin, etc.)
* Simple poll creation functionality, should update for all group members
* Recommendations - for the MVP, we will only suggest one topic (flights or hotels or restaurants)
* Simple common to-do list for each trip

## History
All of us are working on this project because we love to travel, and this means we've each experienced the challenges of keeping track of numerous checklists and suggestions, especially when traveling in a group. There are so many recommendations available online that sometimes we'd just wish for easy, simple suggestions all located in the place. We desire to create a seamless experience that will make group trip planning efficient, simple, and effective.
